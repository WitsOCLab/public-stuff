abstract = {Vector modes are well-defined field distributions with spatially varying polarization states, rendering them irreducible to the product of a single spatial mode and a single polarization state. Traditionally, the spatial degree of freedom of vector modes is constructed using two orthogonal modes from the same family. Here, we introduce a novel class of vector modes whose spatial degree of freedom is encoded by combining modes from both the Hermite– and Laguerre–Gaussian families, ensuring that the modes are shape-invariant upon propagation. This superposition is not arbitrary, and we provide a detailed explanation of the methodology employed to achieve it. This new class of vector modes, which we term hybrid Hermite–Laguerre–Gaussian (HHLG) vector modes, gives rise to subsets of modes exhibiting polarization dependence on propagation due to the difference in mode orders between the constituent modes, while remaining eigenmodes of free space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of vector modes composed of two scalar modes originating from different families.},

abstract = {Atmospheric turbulence typically impairs free-space optical communication systems, particularly those using mode-division multiplexing, by causing detrimental crosstalk among higher-order modes. This interaction can also be harnessed through mode averaging at the receiver and transmitter to passively counteract turbulence effects. Mode averaging involves the simultaneous transmission and detection of multiple, strategically selected modes. Prior research on mode averaging—often referred to as modal diversity—primarily selected modes by using the spread of crosstalk among modes. In this study, we show that it is crucial to include the impact of mode-dependent loss. This is demonstrated by identifying optimal two-mode combinations that maximize received power while efficiently utilizing mode space. The optimal combinations assessed include pairs of orbital angular momentum (OAM), Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), and Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes, as well as mixed pairs of LG and HG modes. Interestingly, it is shown that the optimal combinations are not always the neighboring modes.},

Mitigation techniques typically require complex adaptive optics, digital signal processing or optical amplification to reduce the impact of turbulence. By spacing multiple apertures at distances comparable to the Fried parameter, spatial diversity is introduced, improving turbulence resilience. This paper demonstrates a low complexity implementation of spatial diversity, leveraging four multimode fiber coupled 1 Gbps bi-directional Small Form-factor Pluggables, each near collimated by a spatially separated collection for both power combining and channel selective switching at the receiver. Under real-world turbulent conditions a sustained data rate of 1 Gbps was achieved with 5.71{\%} of frames dropped with a maximum dropout length of 0.90 s over a 24-hour period. Link lengths of up to 1.3 km were experimentally demonstrated.},

abstract = {In analog radio over fiber (A-RoF) systems, linearization is essential to mitigate nonlinear distortions. While many studies have explored both machine learning (ML)-based and traditional linearization schemes for A-RoF, they often do not provide the dataset used to train the ML models. We present a mathematical model for representing A-RoF systems and provide a comprehensive real dataset, which we make available via GitHub. We utilize a software-defined radio (SDR) approach to generate digital samples of the generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) waveform, which are then applied to a real A-RoF system. This dataset, consisting of transmitted and received GFDM waveform samples, enables the training of both traditional and ML-based models, thereby supporting the development of robust linearization schemes. Furthermore, we conduct a performance evaluation of a ML-based digital pre-distortion (DPD) scheme, trained on both synthetic and real datasets. The linearization performance was assessed using key metrics, including the root mean square error vector magnitude (EVMRMS), normalized mean square error (NMSE), and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). The results show that the DPD scheme successfully reduced the EVMRMS from approximately 6{\%} to 2{\%}, along with improvements in NMSE and ACLR. Additionally, the dataset, in conjunction with the memoryless polynomial model presented in this paper, provides a robust framework for characterizing A-RoF systems. Researchers can leverage this publicly available dataset to model A-RoF systems and design novel linearization schemes, thereby minimizing nonlinear distortions and enhancing signal fidelity.},

These distortions have generally prevented single-mode bi-directional systems from being deployed without adaptive optics due to high optical losses. We investigate and compare the performance of both step and graded index multi-mode fibers for bi-directional communications over an emulated 400 m FSO channel. We propose that OM5 graded index fiber will simultaneously provide a near Gaussian optical transmission mode and a factor of greater than 5 increase in the field of view compared to single-mode fiber. We demonstrate that OM5 can support an error-free throughput of 10 Gbps for low-turbulence ( D / r 0 = 3) and 9.1 Gbps for high-turbulence ( D / r 0 = 9) using commercial bi-directional small form-factor pluggable (SFP+) transceivers with no adaptive optical components.},

abstract = {Summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) analyse genetic variation across many individuals to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits. They typically include millions of SNPs from thousands of individuals, creating a multiple testing problem where the probability of false associations increases with the number of SNPs tested. While permutation testing provides accurate control of false positive rates, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets. This research presents an FPGA-based tool designed for cloud deployment on AWS EC2 instances that significantly accelerates GWAS permutation testing for continuous phenotypes. The tool implements two algorithms: maxT and adaptive permutation testing. Performance comparisons using a breast cancer dataset (13.7 million SNPs from 3652 individuals) showed large speedups over PLINK running on 40 CPU cores. For 1000 maxT permutations, the FPGA tool completed analysis in 22 min versus PLINK's 7 days. For 100 million adaptive permutations, FPGA required 325 min compared to PLINK's 8.5 days. The tool handled 700 million adaptive permutations in 33 h—a workload which would require over a month for CPU-based analysis. FPGA solution provides accessible, order-of-magnitude performance improvements without requiring FPGA expertise or dedicated cluster access.},

Here, we present an experimental study of the invariance and distortion of vectorial light through a real-world medium of atmospheric turbulence. We show that the amplitude and polarization structure are both severely distorted by the turbulent medium, yet the non-separability of these two degrees of freedom remains invariant. We monitor this invariance under a range of beam types and atmospheric conditions, over extended time periods, revealing the unitary nature of atmospheric turbulence in our experiment. Our results provide conclusive evidence that invariance and distortion are not mutually exclusive and that the degree of classical entanglement remains unaltered through such channels, and will be of interest to the large community interested in classical and quantum communication in free space.},

abstract = {In direct current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) systems, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) has been a significant challenge. Recently, lexicographical symbol position permutation (LSPP) using random permutations has been introduced as an efficient solution to reduce high PAPR. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of LSPP by comparing both adjacent and interleaved lexicographical permutation sequences with random lexicographical permutation sequences. Our findings demonstrate that random permutation yields superior PAPR reduction performance results when compared to adjacent and interleaved permutation. However, in scenarios with a limited number of sub-blocks, the use of adjacent and interleaved permutation becomes more favorable, as they can eliminate the possibility of generating identical permutation sequences, a drawback of random permutation. Additionally, we propose a novel algorithm to determine the optimal number of candidate permutation sequences that can achieve acceptable PAPR reduction performance while adhering to computational complexity constraints defined by the system requirements.},

The paper suggests a recurrent neural network-based (RNN) solution to predict beam wander in free space optics (FSO). The approach uses past beam center of mass positions to predict future movement, significantly outperforming various prediction types. The proposed approach is demonstrated using under-sampled experimental data over a 260 m link as a worst-case and over-sampled simulated data as a best-case scenario. In addition to conventional Gaussian beams, Hermite- and Laguerre-Gaussian beam wander is also investigated. With a 20 to 40% improvement in error over naive and linear predictions, while predicting multiple samples ahead in typical situations and overall matching or outperforming considered predictions across all studied scenarios, this method could help mitigate turbulence-induced fading and has potential applications in intelligent re-transmits, quality of service, optimized error correction, maximum likelihood-type algorithms, and predictive adaptive optics.},

abstract = {Information exchange between two distant parties, where information is shared without physically transporting it, is a crucial resource in future quantum networks. Doing so with high-dimensional states offers the promise of higher information capacity and improved resilience to noise, but progress to date has been limited. Here we demonstrate how a nonlinear parametric process allows for arbitrary high-dimensional state projections in the spatial degree of freedom, where a strong coherent field enhances the probability of the process. This allows us to experimentally realise quantum transport of high-dimensional spatial information facilitated by a quantum channel with a single entangled pair and a nonlinear spatial mode detector. Using sum frequency generation we upconvert one of the photons from an entangled pair resulting in high-dimensional spatial information transported to the other. We realise a d = 15 quantum channel for arbitrary photonic spatial modes which we demonstrate by faithfully transferring information encoded into orbital angular momentum, Hermite-Gaussian and arbitrary spatial mode superpositions, without requiring knowledge of the state to be sent. Our demonstration merges the nascent fields of nonlinear control of structured light with quantum processes, offering a new approach to harnessing high-dimensional quantum states, and may be extended to other degrees of freedom too.},

abstract = {Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes are topical due to their versatility, and they have been used in several applications including free-space optical communication systems. The classification of OAM modes is a common requirement, and there are several methods available for this. One such method makes use of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks, which distinguishes between modes using their intensities. However, OAM mode intensities are very similar if they have the same radius or if they have opposite topological charges, and as such, intensity-only approaches cannot be used exclusively for individual modes. Since the phase of each OAM mode is unique, deep learning can be used in conjugation with interferometry to distinguish between different modes. In this paper, we demonstrate a very high classification accuracy of a range of OAM modes in turbulence using a shear interferometer, which crucially removes the requirement of a reference beam. For comparison, we show only marginally higher accuracy with a more conventional Mach–Zehnder interferometer, making the technique a promising candidate towards real-time, low-cost modal decomposition in turbulence.},

abstract = {Optical communication is an integral part of the modern economy, having all but replaced electronic communication systems. Future growth in bandwidth appears to be on the horizon using structured light, encoding information into the spatial modes of light, and transmitting them down fibre and free-space, the latter crucial for addressing last mile and digitally disconnected communities. Unfortunately, patterns of light are easily distorted, and in the case of free-space optical communication, turbulence is a significant barrier. Here we review recent progress in structured light in turbulence, first with a tutorial style summary of the core concepts, before highlighting the present state-of-the-art in the field. We support our review with new experimental studies that reveal which types of structured light are best in turbulence, the behaviour of vector versus scalar light in turbulence, the trade-off of diversity and multiplexing, and how turbulence models can be exploited for enhanced optical signal processing protocols. This comprehensive treatise will be invaluable to the large communities interested in free-space optical communication with spatial modes of light.},

In this paper we propose and demonstrate a low-complexity self-aligning FSO prototype that can completely self-align with no requirement for initial manual positioning and could therefore form the opto-mechanical basis for a mesh network of optical transceivers. The prototype utilises off-the-shelf consumer electrical components and a bespoke alignment algorithm. We demonstrate an eight fibre spatially multiplexed link with a loss of 15 dB over 210 m.},

@phdthesis{Cox2019,
abstract = {The work presented extends and contributes to research in mitigating the effects of turbulence in long-range Free Space Optical (FSO) links using structured modes of light. While there is an extensive body of existing research in the use of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) modes for mode division multiplexed communication channels, there has not been an investigation into the use of alternative mode sets and their resilience to atmospheric turbulence. In this thesis several different approaches are investigated, each with a corresponding journal publication. In the research presented it is found that a carefully chosen subset of Hermite- Gauss modes are significantly more resilient to propagation in turbulence than the more commonly used Laguerre-Gauss modes. Knowledge of this independence is exploited in a “modal diversity” proof-of-principle system which is shown to be effective - an intriguing result which exposes several questions about the propaga- tion of higher order modes in turbulence. In this research it is also found that the resilience of vector vortex modes over scalar vortex modes is in fact a misconception and the choice of mode set for FSO should not be based on its vectorial nature. Motivated by the predominant effects of beam wander in the previous investiga- tions, it is shown that turbulence-induced beam wander is neither a memoryless nor a first order memory system as expected when Taylor's frozen-turbulence model is invoked. A more accurate modelling approach for the time-varying nature of turbu- lence induced beam wander is presented which may be used to design optimised mode sets and digital signal processing schemes in future FSO systems},

Free-Space Optical (FSO) communications offer a convenient and higher bandwidth alternative to point-to-point radio microwave links, with the possibility of re-purposing existing infrastructure. Unfortunately, the range of high bandwidth FSO remains limited. While there has been extensive research into an optimal mode set for FSO to achieve maximum data throughput by mode division multiplexing, there has been relatively little work investigating optical modes to improve the resilience of FSO links. Here we experimentally show that a carefully chosen subset of Hermite-Gaussian modes is more resilient to atmospheric turbulence than similar Laguerre-Gauss beams, theoretically resulting in a 167% theoretical increase of propagation distance at a mode dependent loss of 50%.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges for long range, high speed Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication is turbulence induced beam wander. Beam wander causes fluctuations in the received intensity as well as crosstalk in mode division multiplexed systems. Existing models for beam wander make use of probability distributions and long term averages and are not able to accurately model time-dependent intensity fluctuations such as deep fading, where the received intensity is too low to maintain reliable communication for an extended period of time. In this work we present an elegant new memory model which models the behaviour of beam wander induced intensity fluctuations with the unique capability to accurately simulate deep fading. This is invaluable for the development of optimised error correction coding and digital signal processing in order to improve the throughput and reliability of FSO systems.},

abstract = {Waves can carry both linear and angular momentum. When the wave is transverse (e.g. light), the angular momentum can be characterised by the “spin” angular momentum associated with circular polarisation, and the “orbital” angular momentum (OAM) arising from the phase cross-section of the beam. When the wave is longitudinal (e.g. sound) there is no polarization and hence no spin angular momentum. However, a suitably phase-structured sound beam can still carry OAM. Observing the transfer of OAM from sound to a macroscopic object provides an excellent opportunity to study the exchange of energy between waves and matter. In this paper we show how to build a compact free-space acoustic spanner based on a 3D-printed sound-guiding structure and common electronic components. We first characterise the sound fields by measuring both phase and amplitude maps, and then show a video of our free-space acoustic spanner in action, in which macroscopic objects spin in a circular motion and change direction of rotation according to the handedness of the OAM acoustic field.},
